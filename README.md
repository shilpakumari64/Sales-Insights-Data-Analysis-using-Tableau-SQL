# Sales-Insights-Data-Analysis-using-Tableau-SQL
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Sales Insights project, where I performed data analysis using Tableau and SQL. This project focuses on analyzing the sales data of an India-based hardware company and drawing valuable insights to aid in decision-making.

About the Project :

The Sales Insights project involves analyzing the sales data of an India-based hardware company. I developed ETL mappings using SQL to extract data from unstructured sources and transform it into a staging area for data cleaning. Furthermore, I designed a star schema data model on Tableau to facilitate efficient analysis. The project culminates in a Tableau dashboard that provides visualizations and insights based on various parameters affecting the company's performance year on year.

Data Analysis - Approach
To set up and perform the data analysis, follow these steps:

Setup Process :

Download the file: db_dump.xlsx

Import the file into MySQL and perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) if required.

Download Tableau Public (Free) or Tableau Desktop (14-day trial) for data analysis.

Connect Tableau with the MySQL or Excel database.

Save the file as .twb or .twbx.

Data Analysis Using SQL :
Here are some SQL queries that can be used for data analysis:


-- Show all customer records
SELECT * FROM customers;

-- Show the total number of customers
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;

-- Show transactions for Chennai market (market code for Chennai is Mark001)
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE market_code='Mark001';

-- Show distinct product codes that were sold in Chennai.
SELECT DISTINCT product_code FROM transactions WHERE market_code='Mark001';

-- Show transactions where the currency is US dollars.
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE currency='USD';

-- Show transactions in 2020 joined by the date table.
SELECT transactions.*, date.* FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date = date.date WHERE date.year = 2020;

-- Show total revenue in the year 2020.
SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date = date.date WHERE date.year = 2020 AND (transactions.currency = 'INR' OR transactions.currency = 'USD');

-- Show total revenue in the year 2020, January Month.
SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date = date.date WHERE date.year = 2020 AND date.month_name = 'January' AND (transactions.currency = 'INR' OR transactions.currency = 'USD');

-- Show total revenue in the year 2020 in Chennai.
SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date = date.date WHERE date.year = 2020 AND transactions.market_code = 'Mark001';
